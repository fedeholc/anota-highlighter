# Highlighter WebExtension for ANOTA

Highlighter is an extension for the google chrome browser that allows you to highlight text on any web site and save those highlights, then download them or send them to [ANOTA](https://github.com/fedeholc/anota-front-react). It also allows you to save individual links or the entire session of all links opened in the browser.

## How to install the extension

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file with the code (Code > Download ZIP, from the main page of the repository) and then unzip the downloaded ZIP file.
2. On Chrome, go to chrome://extensions/.
3. Enable "Developer Mode".
4. Click on "Load Unpacked".
5. Select the folder that contains the extension code.
6. Click on the extensions icon and then on the icon with the extension pin to make it visible in the toolbar.
7. Done! The extension is installed and ready to use.

## How to use the extension

1. Click on the extension icon to open the popup (or open the extension in the Side Panel).
2. Click on "Start".
3. You can now highlight text on any website.
4. You can also save one or all the links opened in the browser (by clicking on "Save link" or "Save session" respectively).
5. In the extension popup or the Side Panel you can see the highlights you have made (also the saved links) and download them in a text file by clicking on "Download", or send them to ANOTA by clicking on "Send".

To be able to send the highlights to ANOTA it is necessary to log in to the extension with the same email that is used in ANOTA.
